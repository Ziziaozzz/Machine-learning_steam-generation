# Machine learning_steam generation

## Problem background
There are many factors which can affect the steam generation rate of boilers in a power plant. Given some feature variables, try to predict the steam generation rate.

## Data description
We have one training set and one testing set of data. A 'target' variable is in the training set which represents the steam generation rate. 38 feature variables are included in the training set and testing set. All the data are desensitized. MSE (mean square error) is used to evaluate the performance of different models.
